# Efigence Camp Project
Efigence Camp was a workshop for beginner programmers to learn developing web applications. 
## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to create website based on .psd files, which communicates with the API and present received data.
This application is proof of concept and isn't working at all. 
During this project I learnt a lot of new technologies. This was the first time when I had to deal with Sass preprocessors with SCSS syntax. Sass gives a lot possibilities including variables and mixins. What's more I gained knowledge about gulp tasks and generally about HTML and CSS technologies.
## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* gulp
## Plan to develop
The first feature I am going to focus on this page is to make it responsive (RWD).
## Preview
My application is available at https://monias.github.io/efigence/.
First page is a login page [Login Page](https://monias.github.io/efigence/) - you do not need to enter any password - just click "GO".

Second page is a dashboard page [Dashboard Page](https://monias.github.io/efigence/dashboard.html) - this page presents data received from API - to go to third page click "EARN" in header.

Third page is a gameplay page [Gameplay Page](https://monias.github.io/efigence/gameplay.html) - this page presents available services and badges to get.
