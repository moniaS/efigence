# Efigence Camp Project
Efigence Camp was a workshop for beginner programmers to learn developing web applications. 
## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to create website based on .psd files, which communicates with the API and present received data.
During this project I learnt a lot of new technologies. This was the first time when I had to deal with Sass preprocessors with SCSS syntax. Sass gives a lot possibilities including variables and mixins. What's more I gained knowledge about gulp tasks and generally about HTML and CSS technologies.
## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
